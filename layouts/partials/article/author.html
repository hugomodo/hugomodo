      I've said these are aside in my layout... uhmm... but didn't change them...
      Although I guess I'm now wondering whether they should be... uhmm... I...
      ...whether they should be... err... wait... uhmmm... huh...
      I guess they should be either...

      - aside
      - section

      ...but take a look below at how we already contain a section that introduces
      additional articles.

      Note though that.. Aside!! It has to be aside.
        note that it can be removed from main flow without changing any meaning.

      So we'll go with aside for now... which can include a header...
      ...plus all of the sub-articles I want.
    -->
    <section class="authors">
      <header>
        <h2>Author</h2>
      </header>
      <article class="hugoComponent-author">
        {{ partial "author.html" (dict "author" . "headerDepth" 4) }}
      </article>
    </section>
  </footer>
{{ end }}
